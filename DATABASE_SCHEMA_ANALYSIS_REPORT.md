# Telehealth Platform Database Schema and System Data Requirements Analysis Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the comprehensive analysis of the telehealth platform's database schema in relation to the system's data requirements. It identifies critical mismatches, architectural inconsistencies, and provides actionable recommendations to align the database schema with the system's needs for production readiness, data integrity, and compliance.

---

## 1. Multiple Conflicting Database Schemas

- The project contains three distinct schema files:
  - `complete-schema.sql`: Comprehensive healthcare schema with detailed tables and fields.
  - `unified-portal-schema.sql`: Role-based permissions and portal-specific schema updates.
  - `direct-model-schema.sql`: Simplified schema variant for direct telehealth model.

- **Issue**: Lack of a single source of truth leads to confusion and potential data integrity issues.

---

## 2. Backend ORM Models vs Database Schema

- Drizzle ORM models (`backend/src/models/index.js`) define a subset of fields compared to the complete schema.
- Missing critical fields in ORM models include:
  - Medical data (allergies, medical_conditions, current_medications).
  - Shipping and subscription details.
  - Insurance information.
- This mismatch risks incomplete data handling and feature gaps.

---

## 3. Authentication Architecture Mismatch

- Backend auth service expects a unified `users` table with role-based joins.
- Actual database schema uses separate tables for patients, providers, and admins without a unified user table.
- This architectural mismatch complicates authentication, authorization, and user management.

---

## 4. Field Naming and Data Structure Inconsistencies

- Database schema uses snake_case naming convention.
- Backend API routes and frontend types use camelCase.
- Inconsistent naming conventions increase complexity and risk of bugs.
- Some API routes expect fields not present in the database schema or ORM models.

---

## 5. API Routes and Frontend Types

- API routes partially align with the database schema but omit several fields.
- Frontend types are incomplete relative to the database schema, missing subscription, insurance, and medical data fields.
- This leads to potential data loss and UI inconsistencies.

---

## 6. Service Layer Implementation Gaps

- Service layer modules handle partial data models.
- Business logic does not fully utilize all schema fields.
- Error handling and validation for new fields are missing.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

- Consolidate to a single, authoritative database schema (`complete-schema.sql`).
- Update ORM models to fully reflect the consolidated schema.
- Refactor authentication service to align with actual database structure.
- Standardize naming conventions across database, backend, and frontend.
- Update API routes and frontend types to include all necessary fields.

### Medium-Term Actions

- Enhance service layer to support full data model.
- Implement comprehensive validation and error handling.
- Expand test coverage to include new data fields and workflows.

### Long-Term Actions

- Establish strict schema migration and versioning processes.
- Implement monitoring for data integrity and compliance.
- Plan for scalable and secure production deployment.

---

## Conclusion

Resolving the identified mismatches and inconsistencies is critical for the telehealth platform's production readiness, data integrity, and regulatory compliance. A coordinated effort across database, backend, and frontend teams is essential to implement the recommended fixes effectively.
