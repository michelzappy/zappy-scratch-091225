# Deprecated Files Cleanup Report
Date: January 17, 2025

## Summary
Performed a codebase review to identify and remove deprecated, temporary, and obsolete files.

## Files Deleted

### Temporary/Recovered Files
- `recovered_consultation_template.tsx` - Temporary recovery file from previous development
- `temp_consultation.tsx` - Temporary consultation template file

## Files Requiring Review
Based on the open tabs and file naming conventions, the following files appear to be refactored versions that may need review:

### Backend Files
- `backend/src/routes/admin.refactored.js` - Appears to be a refactored version of admin.js routes
  - Status: Keep for now - may be in active development/review

### Frontend Files  
- `frontend/src/app/portal/dashboard/page.refactored.tsx` - Refactored dashboard page
  - Status: Keep for now - may be in active development/review

## Recommendations

1. **Refactored Files**: The `.refactored` files should be reviewed by the development team to determine if:
   - They are ready to replace the original files
   - They should be merged with the original files
   - They can be safely deleted

2. **Documentation Files**: Multiple summary and review markdown files exist in the root directory. Consider consolidating or archiving older documentation:
   - CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md
   - CLEANUP_COMPLETED_SUMMARY.md
   - FINAL_CODEBASE_CLEANUP_2025.md
   - Multiple review and analysis files

3. **Migration Files**: The database/migrations directory appears clean and properly organized.

## Clean Code Practices
Going forward, recommend:
- Using version control branches instead of `.refactored` file extensions
- Removing temporary files immediately after use
- Consolidating documentation files periodically
- Using `.gitignore` to prevent temporary files from being committed

## Impact
- Removed 2 temporary/recovered files
- Improved codebase organization
- Identified potential duplicate/refactored files for team review
