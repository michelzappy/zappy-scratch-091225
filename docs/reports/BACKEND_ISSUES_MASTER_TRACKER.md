## üîÑ Weekly Review Process

### Every Monday:
1. Review progress on current priority group
2. Update completion status in this tracker
3. Identify blockers and dependencies
4. Adjust timeline if needed
5. Plan upcoming week's focus

### Every Friday:
1. Document completed work
2. Test implemented features
3. Update issue status
4. Prepare next week's priorities

## üìû Escalation Path

### If Critical Issues Block Development:
1. **Immediate**: Focus on authentication routes first
2. **Day 2**: Escalate if login still broken
3. **Day 3**: Consider temporary workarounds
4. **Day 5**: Re-evaluate approach if major delays

### If Medium Issues Impact User Experience:
1. **Week 3**: Assess user feedback on missing features
2. **Week 4**: Prioritize based on user impact
3. **Week 5**: Consider MVP vs full feature set
