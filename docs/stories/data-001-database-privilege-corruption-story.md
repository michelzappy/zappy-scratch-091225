# DATA-001: Database Privilege Migration Corruption Prevention

## Story Overview
**Story ID**: DATA-001  
**Risk Level**: Critical (Score: 9)  
**Story Title**: Database Privilege Migration Corruption Prevention  
**Epic**: Security Hardening (Story 1.1)  
**Sprint**: Production Readiness Sprint 1  

## Business Context
Current database operations may be running with excessive privileges, creating risk of data corruption during migration operations or routine maintenance. This poses significant risks to patient data integrity and HIPAA compliance.

## Problem Statement
As identified in our risk assessment, the current database access patterns may allow operations that could corrupt patient records during schema migrations or data updates. We need to implement least-privilege access controls without disrupting critical healthcare operations.

## User Story

**As a** Healthcare Platform Administrator  
**I want** database operations to use least-privilege access patterns with corruption prevention  
**So that** patient data remains protected during all database operations while maintaining emergency access capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Database Role Segregation
- [ ] Create read-only database role for reporting operations
- [ ] Create limited-write role for routine patient updates
- [ ] Create migration-specific role with elevated privileges only during maintenance windows
- [ ] Create emergency override role with full access for critical care situations

### AC2: Migration Safety Framework  
- [ ] Implement pre-migration data validation checksums
- [ ] Create rollback procedures for all migration operations
- [ ] Add migration operation logging with patient identifier hashing
- [ ] Implement automated backup creation before any schema changes

### AC3: Runtime Privilege Management
- [ ] Database connections use appropriate role based on operation type
- [ ] Automatic privilege escalation for emergency situations (patient safety override)
- [ ] Connection pooling with role-based segregation
- [ ] Regular privilege audit logging

### AC4: Data Integrity Monitoring
- [ ] Real-time monitoring of database operations for anomalous patterns
- [ ] Automated alerts for privilege violations or suspicious access patterns
- [ ] Daily data integrity validation checks
- [ ] Patient record checksum validation

### AC5: Emergency Access Procedures
- [ ] Emergency bypass procedures for critical patient care situations
- [ ] Audit trail for all emergency privilege escalations
- [ ] Automatic privilege de-escalation after emergency periods
- [ ] Healthcare provider notification system for access restrictions

## Technical Implementation

### Database Roles
```sql
-- Read-only role for reporting
CREATE ROLE zappy_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO zappy_readonly;

-- Limited write role for patient updates
CREATE ROLE zappy_patient_update;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON patients, consultations, orders TO zappy_patient_update;

-- Migration role (used only during maintenance)
CREATE ROLE zappy_migration;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO zappy_migration;

-- Emergency role for critical care
CREATE ROLE zappy_emergency;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO zappy_emergency;
```

### Connection Management
- Implement database connection factory with role-based connection creation
- Connection pooling with separate pools for each privilege level
- Automatic connection role switching based on operation context

### Migration Safety
- Pre-migration validation scripts
- Automated rollback capability
- Patient data checksum validation
- Migration operation audit logging

## Definition of Done

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] All database roles created and properly configured
- [ ] Connection management factory implemented and tested
- [ ] Migration safety framework operational
- [ ] Data integrity monitoring system active
- [ ] Emergency access procedures documented and tested

### Security Requirements  
- [ ] All database operations use least necessary privileges
- [ ] Migration operations logged with HIPAA-compliant audit trail
- [ ] Emergency access properly logged and time-limited
- [ ] Privilege escalation requires appropriate authorization

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for connection factory and role management
- [ ] Integration tests for migration safety procedures
- [ ] End-to-end testing of emergency access procedures
- [ ] Load testing with role-based connection pools
- [ ] Security testing for privilege violations

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Database privilege documentation updated
- [ ] Emergency access procedures documented
- [ ] Migration safety procedures documented
- [ ] Operations runbook updated with new procedures

## Risk Mitigation
- **Before Implementation**: Risk Score 9 (Critical)
- **After Implementation**: Risk Score 2 (Low)
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Implement least-privilege access with emergency bypass capabilities
- **Rollback Plan**: Emergency role can be activated to restore full access if needed

## Dependencies
- Database connection pooling library (pg-pool or equivalent)
- Migration framework (existing Drizzle setup)
- Monitoring system integration
- Emergency notification system

## Acceptance Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Patient Data Access
**Given** a healthcare provider needs to access patient records
**When** they perform standard patient lookup operations  
**Then** the system uses read-only privileges and logs the access appropriately

### Scenario 2: Patient Data Update
**Given** a provider needs to update patient information
**When** they submit changes through the portal
**Then** the system uses limited-write privileges and validates data integrity

### Scenario 3: Database Migration
**Given** a scheduled maintenance migration is needed
**When** the migration process starts
**Then** the system creates backups, validates data, uses migration role, and logs all operations

### Scenario 4: Emergency Access
**Given** a critical patient care situation requires immediate data access
**When** emergency access is requested by authorized personnel
**Then** the system grants emergency privileges, logs the escalation, and sets automatic de-escalation

### Scenario 5: Privilege Violation Detection
**Given** a database operation attempts to exceed assigned privileges
**When** the violation is detected
**Then** the system blocks the operation, logs the incident, and alerts administrators

## Timeline
- **Story Points**: 13
- **Estimated Duration**: 3-4 days
- **Priority**: Critical (must complete for Story 1.1 quality gate)

## Notes
- This implementation requires coordination with the database team
- Emergency procedures must be tested with healthcare operations staff
- All privilege changes must maintain HIPAA compliance requirements
- Patient safety must be prioritized over security restrictions in emergency situations
