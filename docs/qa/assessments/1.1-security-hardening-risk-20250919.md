## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. [SEC-001]: HIPAA Patient Data Exposure During Audit Implementation

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability:** High (3) - Complex audit logging implementation in production healthcare system  
**Impact:** High (3) - HIPAA violation, potential $1.5M+ fines, patient trust loss  
**Affected Components:** All patient data endpoints, database layer, audit logging system

**Risk Description:** Implementation of comprehensive audit logging for patient data access may inadvertently expose or log sensitive patient information in plain text, violating HIPAA technical safeguards.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Implement audit logging with encrypted patient identifiers only
- Use data masking for audit logs (log patient ID hash, not actual data)
- Conduct HIPAA compliance review before each deployment phase
- Implement audit log encryption at rest and in transit
- Establish audit log retention policies compliant with HIPAA requirements

**Testing Focus:** 
- HIPAA compliance validation testing
- Audit log content security testing
- Data encryption verification testing
- Patient data exposure penetration testing

### 2. [SEC-002]: Authentication System Integration Failure

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability:** High (3) - Complex hybrid Supabase/JWT authentication modification  
**Impact:** High (3) - Complete system access failure, provider/patient lockout  
**Affected Components:** Authentication middleware, Supabase integration, JWT handling, session management

**Risk Description:** Modifying the existing hybrid authentication system (Supabase + JWT) to meet HIPAA requirements could break authentication for providers and patients, causing system-wide access failure.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Implement authentication changes in isolated environment first
- Maintain backward compatibility with current auth tokens during transition
- Implement gradual rollout with immediate rollback capability
- Create emergency authentication bypass for critical healthcare operations
- Comprehensive authentication integration testing

**Testing Focus:**
- Authentication system integration testing
- Session management continuity testing
- Provider/patient login flow testing
- Emergency access procedure testing

### 3. [DATA-001]: Database Privilege Migration Corruption

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability:** Medium (2) - Complex database privilege restructuring  
**Impact:** High (3) - Patient data loss, consultation history corruption  
**Affected Components:** PostgreSQL database, Drizzle ORM, all data access layers

**Risk Description:** Implementing least privilege database access and role-based access control could corrupt existing patient records or consultation history if migration scripts fail.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Complete database backup before any privilege changes
- Test privilege migration on production data copy
- Implement gradual privilege restriction with verification steps
- Maintain read-only administrator access during transition
- Database integrity verification scripts after each migration step

**Testing Focus:**
- Database migration integrity testing
- Data consistency verification testing
- Access control validation testing
- Database backup/recovery testing

**Mitigation:** Gradual certificate pinning rollout with service-specific testing

### 5. [PERF-001]: Healthcare Workflow Performance Degradation

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability:** Medium (2) - Input validation and audit logging overhead  
**Impact:** High (3) - >2s response times violating NFR1, provider workflow disruption  

**Mitigation:** Performance testing with healthcare workload patterns, caching optimization

### 6. [BUS-001]: HIPAA Compliance Implementation Delays

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability:** High (3) - Complex regulatory requirements  
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Production go-live delays, regulatory scrutiny  

**Mitigation:** HIPAA compliance expert consultation, phased compliance implementation

### 7. [OPS-001]: Security Monitoring Implementation Gaps

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability:** Medium (2) - New security monitoring complexity  
**Impact:** High (3) - Undetected security breaches, incident response failures  

**Mitigation:** Security monitoring integration testing, incident response procedure updates
