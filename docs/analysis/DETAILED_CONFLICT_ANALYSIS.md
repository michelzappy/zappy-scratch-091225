## Decision Framework

### Priority Levels:

2. **HIGH** - Backend routes (core functionality)
3. **MEDIUM** - Frontend components (user experience)
4. **LOW** - Shell scripts, Docker config (deployment)

### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Completeness**: Which version has more features?
- **Code Quality**: Which has better error handling, validation?
- **Performance**: Which is more optimized?
- **Security**: Which has better security measures?
- **Maintainability**: Which is cleaner, more documented?
- **Testing**: Which has test coverage?

### Recommended Approach:
1. Start with database schemas - compare carefully
2. Review backend routes for feature completeness
3. Check frontend components for UI/UX quality
4. Verify deployment scripts match your infrastructure

## Quick Resolution Commands

For files where you decide to keep one version entirely:

```bash
# Keep your version
git checkout --ours <filename>

# Keep their version  
git checkout --theirs <filename>

# After choosing
git add <filename>
```

For files requiring manual merge:
1. Open in VSCode
2. Use merge conflict resolver
3. Test thoroughly
4. Stage the resolved file
