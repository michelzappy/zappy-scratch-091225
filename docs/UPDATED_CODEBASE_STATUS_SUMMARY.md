## Critical Issues and Recommendations

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities

- **Hardcoded JWT Secrets**: Multiple locations fallback to insecure hardcoded secrets (`development-secret-key-change-in-production`), risking authentication bypass.
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Hardcoded audit salt used for patient ID hashing, violating HIPAA requirements and risking patient re-identification.
- **Frontend Secret Exposure**: Supabase anon keys and URLs are hardcoded in frontend source code, exposing sensitive credentials.

### 2. Debug and Test Code in Production

- Over 300 `console.log` and `console.error` statements remain in production code, exposing sensitive information.
- Test scripts and demo authentication modes are present in production paths.

### 3. Documentation Discrepancies

- Previous documentation overstated security and production readiness.
- No warnings about critical security risks or required environment variable configuration.

## Immediate Actions Required Before Production Deployment

1. Replace all hardcoded secrets with environment variables.
2. Remove hardcoded HIPAA audit salts and implement secure salt rotation.
3. Remove all debug and test code from production builds.
4. Implement strict environment variable validation and secret management.
5. Update documentation to reflect current security posture and readiness.
6. Add monitoring and alerting for security and compliance issues.

## Summary

While the system architecture and feature set are strong, the current codebase contains critical security flaws and debug artifacts that prevent safe production deployment. The documentation has been updated to reflect these realities and guide remediation efforts.
