   - Backward compatibility testing framework
   - Emergency authentication bypass procedures

3. **Database Migration Safety Framework**
   - Complete production data backup procedures
   - Privilege migration testing on production data copy
   - Database integrity verification scripts

**Test Coverage Required:**
- **42 Test Scenarios** across Unit (18), Integration (16), E2E (8)
- **P0 Priority:** 24 tests covering critical security functionality
- **HIPAA Validation:** Comprehensive compliance testing framework

### Remaining Production Stories (Dependent on 1.1 Completion)

| Story | Focus | Status | Dependencies |
|-------|-------|--------|--------------|
| **1.2** | Database Performance & Scaling | ‚è≥ Blocked | 1.1 database security completion |
| **1.3** | Monitoring & Alerting | ‚è≥ Blocked | 1.1 security framework |
| **1.4** | CI/CD Pipeline & Deployment | ‚è≥ Blocked | 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 completion |
| **1.5** | Error Handling & Resilience | ‚è≥ Blocked | All previous stories |

## Healthcare-Specific Compliance Requirements

### HIPAA Technical Safeguards (Critical)

**Required Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ **Access Control:** Unique user identification, automatic logoff, encryption
- ‚úÖ **Audit Controls:** Hardware, software, procedural mechanisms for monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Integrity:** PHI alteration/destruction protection mechanisms
- ‚úÖ **Person/Entity Authentication:** Verify user identity before access
- ‚úÖ **Transmission Security:** End-to-end encryption for all PHI transmissions

**Compliance Timeline:** Must be completed before any production patient data handling

### Performance Requirements (Healthcare Critical)

**Non-Negotiable Standards:**
- **99.9% Uptime:** Healthcare operations cannot tolerate significant downtime
- **<2 Second Response Times:** Provider workflow efficiency requirements
- **100K+ Concurrent Users:** Scalability for healthcare organization growth
- **Sub-4 Hour RPO:** Patient data recovery requirements

## Technology Stack Assessment
