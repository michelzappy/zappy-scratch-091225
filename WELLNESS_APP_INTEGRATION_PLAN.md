- Mobile Bottom Nav (3 hours)
- Notes System (5 hours)
- Total: ~12 hours this week

**Option B: Go Big with AI** (High Risk/High Reward)
- AI Health Assistant (8 hours)
- Skip other features for now
- Big wow factor but longer timeline

**Option C: Data-Driven Approach**
- Progress Charts (6 hours)
- Treatment Plan Dashboard (4 hours)
- Focus on metrics & tracking

## 🤔 MY ADVICE

Based on 15 years in healthcare software:

**Do Option A** - Start with the quick wins to build momentum and prove value quickly. Then add the AI assistant when you have solid foundation.

**Why?**
1. Lower risk (smaller changes)
2. Faster to market (12 hours vs 8+ hours for AI alone)
3. Better testing (multiple small features easier to debug)
4. User feedback (learn what users want before big AI investment)
5. Foundation building (these features support the AI later)

The AI assistant is amazing, but it works best when you have good data (progress charts), clear context (treatment plans), and patient engagement (notes system) already in place.
