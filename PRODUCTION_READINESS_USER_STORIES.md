### Epic: Database Schema Consolidation

#### Story 1.1: Database Schema Consolidation
**Title:** Consolidate Conflicting Database Schemas

As a **DevOps Engineer**,  
I want to consolidate the conflicting database schemas into a single authoritative schema,  
So that the application has a consistent data model that prevents authentication failures and data integrity issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. [`database/complete-schema.sql`](database/complete-schema.sql:1) is designated as the single source of truth
2. [`database/unified-portal-schema.sql`](database/unified-portal-schema.sql:1) is archived or removed to prevent conflicts
3. All database migrations successfully apply the consolidated schema
4. Database schema validation tests pass with 100% success rate
5. No conflicting table definitions exist between schema files

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**
- Backup existing data before schema consolidation
- Validate field name mapping between camelCase (backend) and snake_case (database)
