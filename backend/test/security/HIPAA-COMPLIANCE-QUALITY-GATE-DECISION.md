## üö® Critical Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. **CRITICAL**: Hardcoded Salt Vulnerability
**File:** [`backend/src/middleware/hipaaAudit.js:9`](backend/src/middleware/hipaaAudit.js:9)  
**Code:** `const AUDIT_SALT = process.env.HIPAA_AUDIT_SALT || '$2a$10$HIPAAAuditSaltForPatientIDs';`

**Impact:**
- **Patient Re-identification**: Dictionary attacks possible
- **Regulatory Violation**: HIPAA 164.312(a)(2)(i) and 164.514(a) non-compliance
- **System-wide Exposure**: ALL patient audit records compromised
- **Financial Risk**: $1.5M+ potential fines

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// VULNERABILITY DEMONSTRATION
const patientId = 'patient-123';
const predictableHash = bcrypt.hashSync(patientId, '$2a$10$HIPAAAuditSaltForPatientIDs');
// Same input always produces same hash - enables re-identification
```

### 2. **HIGH**: Environment Variable Security Gaps
**Impact:**
- Missing validation for critical configuration
- No enforcement of complexity requirements
- Insufficient rotation policies

**Evidence:**
- 37.5% success rate in environment security tests
- Multiple injection attack vectors detected
- Configuration leakage in logging scenarios

### 3. **MEDIUM**: Audit Trail Integrity Concerns
**Impact:**
- Limited tamper detection mechanisms
- Insufficient cryptographic protections

**Evidence:**
- 80% success rate indicates gaps in integrity controls
- Missing cryptographic signing implementation
