## üé® Current Issue

**Problem:** Coral (rose-500) is overpowering on CTA buttons and throughout interface
- Too vibrant for medical context
- Causes visual fatigue
- Feels less professional

---

## üí¨ Specialist Discussion

### Sarah Chen (Healthcare UX):
> "In healthcare, we need to inspire **calm confidence**, not excitement. Coral works as an accent, but for primary CTAs, we should use **neutral darks**. Think Calm app, Headspace - they use soft colors with strong dark CTAs. This creates trust."

**Recommendation:**
- Primary CTAs: Dark slate/black (`slate-900`)
- Coral: Only for accents, highlights, active states
- Keep interface light and airy

---

### Marcus Rodriguez (Brand Strategy):
> "Coral differentiates us from competitors (Hims = blue, Ro = purple), but it should be **the garnish, not the main dish**. Our brand voice is 'warm but professional'. Solution: Dark CTAs, coral as emotional touchpoints."

**Recommendation:**
- Logo: Coral ‚úì
- Active nav: Coral backgrounds ‚úì
- Buttons: Dark with subtle coral on hover
- Success states: Keep emerald (medical universal)

---

### Yuki Tanaka (Accessibility):
> "Rose-500 on white backgrounds has good contrast (4.5:1), but dark buttons on white have **superior contrast** (21:1). For medical information where clarity is critical, we must prioritize readability. Dark buttons are WCAG AAA compliant."

**Recommendation:**
- All CTAs: `bg-slate-900 hover:bg-slate-800`
- Keep coral for non-critical UI elements
- High contrast = medical safety

---

### Elena Volkov (Color Psychology):
> "Coral = warmth, approachability. Black = trust, authority. In healthcare, patients need **both**. Use coral to make them feel welcomed (logo, accents), black to make them feel confident in taking action (buttons, important text)."

**Recommendation:**
- Warm welcome: Coral accents
- Confident action: Dark CTAs
- Balance: 80% neutral, 15% coral, 5% emerald

---

### David Kim (Telemedicine Product):
> "I've designed 3 telehealth platforms. Best performing design: **Neutral base + subtle color accents**. Users complete more actions with dark buttons. They see them as 'official' and 'safe'. Coral buttons feel 'promotional', dark buttons feel 'medical'."

**Recommendation:**
- Primary: Dark slate buttons
- Secondary: Light slate buttons
- Danger: Rose-600 (darker coral)
- Info: Keep coral very subtle

---

## ‚úÖ Team Consensus

### Refined Color System

**Primary Actions (Buttons, CTAs):**
```css
.btn-primary {
  bg-slate-900
  hover:bg-slate-800
  text-white
}

.btn-secondary {
  bg-slate-100
  hover:bg-slate-200
  text-slate-900
}
```

**Coral Usage (Limited to):**
1. Logo
2. Active navigation states (light bg-rose-50)
3. Icon accents (text-rose-600)
4. Small badges
5. Progress indicators (thin bars)
6. Link hover states

**NOT for:**
- ‚ùå Primary CTA buttons
- ‚ùå Large colored areas
- ‚ùå Form inputs (keep neutral)
- ‚ùå Success states (use emerald)

## üìä Before/After Comparison

</button>
```
**Issue:** Vibrant, promotional, tiring

### After (Refined):
```jsx
<button className="bg-slate-900 hover:bg-slate-800 border border-transparent hover:border-rose-600">
  Request Refill
</button>
```
**Better:** Professional, trustworthy, subtle accent
